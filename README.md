# Boolean-Logic-to-Venn-Diagram

-----------------------------------------
DEPENDENCIES
pygame (pip install pygame)
-----------------------------------------
Instructions
Run the render.py file. You can type in 
the following:
a, b, c, and then &, | and !.
For programmers, & and | represent AND 
and OR respectively.
! represents NOT.
For mathematicians, & represents 
intersection, | union,
and ! complement / inverse.
-----------------------------------------
You MUST seperate terms with spaces.
a & !b is valid, because the complement 
is part of the term.
-----------------------------------------
Does NOT support parenthesis (YET)
I highly recommend you read the code
as the execution is interesting.
